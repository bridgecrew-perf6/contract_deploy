# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

#### Change file .env:
* `INFURA_URL` Your url infura
* `PRIVATE_KEY` Your private key
* `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` Your API key for Etherscan


```shell
npm i 
npx hardhat --network rinkeby deploy --tags Token
```
